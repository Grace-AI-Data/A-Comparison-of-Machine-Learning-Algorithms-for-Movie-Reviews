# A-Comparison-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Movie-Reviews

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that allows computers to understand the underlying subjective tone of a piece of writing. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods are used in sensitivity prediction in our research. We used the Large Movie Review Dataset for our research. The dataset contains information about 50,000 movie reviews and their corresponding polarity score. We used seven ML algorithms on the dataset to predict sensitivity. We found that the model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works well on sensitivity prediction with 92.0 % accuracy.

Large Movie Review Dataset: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. It contains a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided.
