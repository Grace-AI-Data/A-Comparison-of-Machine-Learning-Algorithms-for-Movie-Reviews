# A-Comparison-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Movie-Reviews

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that allows computers to understand the underlying subjective tone of a piece of writing. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods are used in sensitivity prediction in our research. We used the Large Movie Review Dataset for our research. The dataset contains information about 50,000 movie reviews and their corresponding polarity score. We used seven ML algorithms on the dataset to predict sensitivity. We found that the model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works well on sensitivity prediction with 92.0 % accuracy.
